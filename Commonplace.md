# How to keep a commonplace book: a simple system. 

## Goals

After reading this document, user should be able to use a commonplace book to organize notes, research, and ideas for daily use. This system is not a task tracker, calender, etc.

### Tools

To get started, you will only need two tools: a notebook and a writing utensil (pen or pencil). You can use addtional tools like sticky notes, stickers, highlighters, etc - but they are not needed for the base system. 

### Getting Started

On the first page of your notebook, write the following on the top of the page:

 ``` 
# Table of Contents 
 ``` 

On the bottom of the page, write the page number: 0. Every page number after the table of contents will increase by a unit of 1 (so page 1, page 2, page 3...) until you reach the end of the notebook. You can add page numbers as you write in new pages. 

Under the title, write the following:

 ``` 
Table of contents: 0
 ``` 

This is how you log sections of your commonplace book in the table of contents. You take the section title (the words on the top of the page following the # symbol) followed by a :X, where X is the page number the section can be found on. 

### Notation 

THe first headings is #, as described in the pervious section. This heading is called the **section** - it is the title that describes what the page (or next few pages) are talking about. 

Then you have the $#^x$ - this is the **the subheading** and it is used to organize a section into parts. Sometimes you might want to organize a subheading, so you will want to use a **subsection** which is denoted as $#^x.x$ - where x.x replresnets the sbheading and order of the subsection.

Lets give an exmaple:

 ``` 
# Title

This is a section with the name: Title.

$#^1$ Suhheading

This is subheading one.

$#^1.1$

This is subsection one of subheading one.
 ```

After writting a new section, make sure to add it to the table of contents!

If you want to reference a pervious section or page, you can use ; - an example:

 ```
# Another Title ; pg. 3
 ```

This indicates that the content on page three is related to this section. Another example:

 ```
Some text that is in a sentence. : Section: Title
 ```
This indicates that the information in this sentence is related to the information found in the section named "Title", and you can use the table of contents to find the page number. 

### Now start writting. 

That is it! With this simple system, you can start orgnazing your ideas and notes with a notebook!
